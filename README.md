# Pi-ST7565-LCD12864
ST7565 Graphics LCD Python library for Raspberry Pi when used with LCD12864 module.

The code this is based on was for an Adafruit module.  I have modified to work with cheap LCD modules from China.  Changes are:
1. Default contast changes so image visible.
2. Comment for contrast function reflects true range supported.
3. X shift corrected for this display.
4. Page order corrected for this display.

This was forked from [rdagger](https://github.com/rdagger/Pi-ST7565).  The details below are from his README.md:
